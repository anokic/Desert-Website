# Desert Website

JPG to HTML

Website is made for pure fun and experiece no profit or commercial use. I loved the design wanted to recreate it in HTML. Plane and simple.

Using photoshop i deconstructed the whole website and images so i can use on website. I learned so much about Photoshop and started to enjoy it.

What i done:

1. **HTML** / Sematic **HTML5** 
2. **CSS** / reset.css / **SASS**
3. **JavaScript** / **jQuery**
4. **GULP**
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> a) Minify **JavaScript** and **CSS**
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> b) Autoprexises
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> c) Cache
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> d) **SASS** watch
5. **PHOTOSHOP**

I made custom video controls for the video with **JavaScript** and static 3D slider with vanilla **JavaScript**
